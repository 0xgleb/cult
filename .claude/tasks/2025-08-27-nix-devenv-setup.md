# Nix Development Environment Setup - 2025-08-27

## Overview

Set up a comprehensive Nix flake with devenv.sh for the Haskell learning platform "cult", including all development tools and pre-commit hooks for both Haskell and TypeScript development.

## Design Decisions

### Why devenv.sh over plain Nix flake?

- Provides higher-level abstractions for development environments
- Better integration with pre-commit hooks via git-hooks.nix
- Cleaner configuration for language-specific tooling
- Built-in support for services and processes

### Tool Selection Rationale

- **Stack**: Industry standard for Haskell project management, better than cabal for complex projects
- **fourmolu**: Maintained fork of ormolu with better configuration options
- **pnpm**: Faster and more efficient than npm/yarn for TypeScript projects
- **taplo**: Fast TOML formatter and linter, essential for Rust/Cargo projects
- **git-hooks.nix**: Declarative pre-commit hooks that work well with Nix
- **nix-direnv**: Caches development shells for faster activation

## Implementation Plan

### Section 1: Core Nix Flake Setup ✅

- [x] Create `flake.nix` with devenv.sh input
- [x] Configure nixpkgs and devenv inputs with latest stable versions
- [x] Set up basic devShell output structure
- [x] Test basic flake evaluation with `nix flake check --impure`

**Implementation Details:**

- Used `nix flake init -t github:cachix/devenv#flake-parts` to initialize with proper flake-parts template
- Template automatically configured nixpkgs, devenv, flake-parts, and other required inputs
- Generated proper devShell structure with devenv.shells.default configuration
- Created `.envrc` file for direnv integration
- Added `.devenv` to `.gitignore` as recommended
- Generated `flake.lock` with all input dependencies pinned
- Basic flake evaluation works (minor platform-specific package issue doesn't affect core functionality)

### Section 2: Haskell Development Environment ✅

- [x] Add Stack package manager (latest LTS resolver)
- [x] Configure GHC compiler with common language extensions
- [x] Add Haskell Language Server (HLS) for IDE support
- [x] Include hlint for static analysis and linting
- [x] Add fourmolu for consistent code formatting
- [x] Configure PATH and environment variables for Haskell tools

**Implementation Details:**

- Configured `languages.haskell` with GHC as the main compiler package (automatically provides Stack and Haskell Language Server)
- Added hlint and fourmolu as manual packages since they're not included in the language configuration
- Set environment variables `STACK_SYSTEM_GHC=1` and `STACK_IN_NIX_SHELL=1` for proper Stack/Nix integration
- All tools are now available in the development environment and properly configured for Haskell development

### Section 3: TypeScript Development Environment ✅

- [x] Add Node.js LTS version (latest stable)
- [x] Include pnpm package manager for dependency management
- [x] Add TypeScript compiler for type checking
- [x] Configure eslint for JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- [x] Add prettier for code formatting
- [x] Set up proper NODE_PATH and npm global directories

**Implementation Details:**

- Configured `languages.javascript` with Node.js LTS as the main package and enabled pnpm support (automatically provides Node.js runtime and pnpm package manager)
- Configured `languages.typescript` to enable TypeScript compiler support (automatically provides TypeScript compiler)
- Devenv automatically handles PATH configuration for all language tools, keeping environment variables minimal
- All TypeScript development tools are now available in the development environment with proper configuration

### Section 4: Pre-commit Hooks Configuration ✅

- [x] Integrate git-hooks.nix for declarative pre-commit setup
- [x] Configure Nix-specific hooks:
  - [x] deadnix - detect unused Nix code
  - [x] statix - static analysis for Nix expressions
  - [x] nixfmt-classic - format Nix code consistently
  - [x] nil - Nix language server diagnostics
- [x] Configure Haskell hooks:
  - [x] fourmolu formatting enforcement
- [x] Configure TypeScript/JavaScript hooks:
  - [x] prettier formatting for JS/TS/JSON/YAML
  - [x] eslint for code quality checks
- [x] Add yamlfmt for YAML file formatting
- [x] Add taplo for TOML file formatting and linting
- [x] Test pre-commit hook installation and execution

**Implementation Details:**

- Added git-hooks.nix input to flake.nix inputs
- Configured comprehensive git-hooks.hooks in devenv shell configuration including:
  - Nix tooling: deadnix (unused code detection), statix (static analysis), nixfmt-classic (formatting), nil (language server)
  - Haskell tooling: fourmolu (formatting enforcement)
  - TypeScript/JavaScript tooling: prettier (formatting), eslint (linting)
  - General file formatting: yamlfmt (YAML), taplo (TOML)
- Fixed unused lambda patterns in flake.nix identified by deadnix (removed unused devenv-root, config, self', inputs', system parameters)
- Successfully tested pre-commit hook installation and execution with all hooks passing
- Verified hooks run automatically and catch formatting/linting issues
- All hooks are working correctly and will run automatically on git commits

### Section 5: Git Configuration ✅

- [x] Update `.gitignore` with comprehensive development artifacts:
  - [x] Nix build outputs (`result`, `result-*`)
  - [x] Direnv cache (`.direnv/`)
  - [x] Haskell build artifacts (`.stack-work/`, `dist-newstyle/`)
  - [x] TypeScript/Node artifacts (`node_modules/`, `.pnpm-store/`, `.next/`)
  - [x] Editor temporary files

**Implementation Details:**

- Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive coverage of development artifacts:
  - Nix build outputs: `result`, `result-*` symlinks
  - Development environment cache: `.devenv/`, `.direnv/`
  - Haskell build artifacts: `.stack-work/`, `dist/`, `dist-newstyle/`, compiled files (`*.hi`, `*.o`, etc.), HPC coverage data
  - TypeScript/Node.js artifacts: `node_modules/`, `.pnpm-store/`, framework-specific directories (`.next/`, `.nuxt/`, `.vite/`, `.vercel/`), TypeScript build info, package manager logs
  - Editor temporary files: VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Vim swap files, OS-specific files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
  - General build and environment files: local environment files, build directories, test coverage output
- All major development artifacts are now properly ignored to keep the repository clean

### Section 6: Documentation Updates ✅
