# Implementation Plan: Haskell Learning Platform

## Core Architecture Requirements

### System Architecture Specification

The platform architecture consists of three primary components: a Haskell backend using Servant for API development, a React frontend with TypeScript, Effect, and shadcn UI components, and an in-browser Haskell execution engine powered by GHC's WebAssembly backend. The entire system operates within a Nix Flakes managed monorepo structure, ensuring reproducible builds across all environments.

The backend implements a three-layer architecture pattern separating domain logic, application services, and infrastructure concerns. Authentication uses JWT tokens with servant-auth, while the database layer employs Persistent with PostgreSQL for type-safe operations. The API specification follows OpenAPI 3.0 standards, serving as the single source of truth for type generation across both backend and frontend.

The frontend application leverages Effect for functional TypeScript patterns, providing robust error handling and dependency injection similar to Haskell's IO monad. The UI component library uses shadcn for consistent, accessible, and customizable interface elements. Deployment targets Vercel's edge network for optimal global performance and automatic scaling.

## Epic 1: In-Browser Haskell Execution Engine

### Requirements and Specifications

The execution engine must support full GHC language features including Template Haskell, GADTs, TypeFamilies, and at least fifteen commonly used language extensions that appear in production Haskell codebases. The system needs to compile and execute Haskell code entirely within the browser using GHC's WebAssembly backend, providing compilation times under ten seconds for typical exercise solutions.

Security boundaries require multiple isolation layers: WebAssembly's native sandboxing, resource limits enforced through WASI capabilities, memory consumption capped at 512MB per execution, CPU time limited to thirty seconds, and output restricted to 1MB. The engine must prevent network access, file system operations beyond a virtual workspace, and any form of system calls that could compromise browser security.

The implementation integrates GHC 9.12 or later compiled to WebAssembly, with a JavaScript interface layer managing compilation requests, execution contexts, and output streaming. The system maintains a cache of pre-compiled standard library modules to reduce compilation overhead. Error messages must be parsed and enhanced with exercise-specific hints before presentation to users.

## Epic 2: Exercise System and Curriculum Engine

### Requirements and Specifications

The exercise system supports three distinct exercise types, each with specific execution and validation patterns. Fix-the-code exercises present broken Haskell code that students repair to pass predefined test cases. Implementation exercises require students to write functions satisfying QuickCheck properties or unit tests. Exploration exercises provide working code that students modify to understand concepts through guided experimentation.

Each exercise contains metadata defining learning objectives, prerequisite concepts, estimated completion time, and difficulty rating. The system tracks which language extensions and libraries are available for each exercise, preventing access to features not yet introduced in the curriculum. Exercise definitions include starter code, solution templates, test harnesses, and contextual hints triggered by specific error patterns.

The curriculum engine sequences exercises into modules and tracks dependencies between concepts. It implements adaptive difficulty adjustment based on student performance, suggesting review exercises when students struggle with new concepts. The system maintains a knowledge graph of Haskell concepts, mapping from familiar Rust patterns to equivalent Haskell constructs for targeted learning paths.

## Epic 3: Backend API and Data Management

### Requirements and Specifications

The Servant backend exposes RESTful endpoints for user management, exercise retrieval, solution submission, progress tracking, and leaderboard functionality. Each endpoint uses type-level routing with automatic OpenAPI documentation generation. The API implements rate limiting per user and global throttling for compilation requests to prevent resource exhaustion.

The data model encompasses users with authentication credentials and profiles, courses containing ordered module sequences, exercises with associated test cases and solutions, submissions tracking user attempts with compilation results, and progress metrics aggregating completion statistics. Persistent migrations handle schema evolution while maintaining data integrity across deployments.

Integration with external services includes OAuth providers for social authentication, email services for notifications and password resets, and analytics platforms for learning metrics. The backend implements webhook endpoints for GitHub integration, allowing students to submit solutions via pull requests for advanced exercises.

## Epic 4: Frontend Application and User Experience

### Requirements and Specifications

The React application provides a responsive interface adapting to desktop and mobile viewports. The code editor integrates Monaco Editor with Haskell syntax highlighting, inline error annotations, and autocomplete suggestions based on available imports. The UI displays compilation output with syntax-highlighted error messages and clickable error locations that navigate to problematic code sections.

Navigation implements a course structure view showing module progression and completion status. The dashboard presents personal progress metrics, recent activity, and suggested next exercises. Social features include solution sharing after exercise completion, discussion threads per exercise, and mentor feedback on submissions.

The Effect integration manages application state through dependency injection patterns, handling authentication flows, API communication, and error boundaries. Complex UI interactions like real-time compilation feedback and collaborative features use Effect's stream processing capabilities for reactive updates. Type safety extends through the entire frontend with generated TypeScript types from the OpenAPI specification.

## Epic 5: Infrastructure and Deployment

### Requirements and Specifications

The Nix Flakes configuration defines development shells with all required tooling for backend and frontend development. The flake provides reproducible builds for Docker containers, development environments, and CI/CD pipelines. Environment-specific overrides handle differences between development, staging, and production deployments.

GitHub Actions workflows implement continuous integration with build verification, test execution, and linting checks on every pull request. The deployment pipeline uses deploy-rs for zero-downtime backend deployments to NixOS servers. Frontend deployments trigger automatically to Vercel upon main branch updates, with preview deployments for pull requests enabling stakeholder review before merging.

Infrastructure as Code principles govern all deployment configurations. Terraform manages cloud resources including database instances, Redis clusters, and CDN distributions. Kubernetes manifests define backend service deployments with horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU and memory metrics. Monitoring uses Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization dashboards.

## Epic 6: Progress Tracking and Analytics

### Requirements and Specifications

The progress tracking system captures granular learning events including exercise attempts, compilation results, time spent per exercise, and hint usage patterns. Analytics aggregation produces student-level metrics showing concept mastery, learning velocity, and engagement patterns. Cohort-level analytics identify common struggle points, popular learning paths, and curriculum effectiveness metrics.

The system implements spaced repetition algorithms suggesting review exercises based on forgetting curves. Mastery tracking uses multi-dimensional skill assessments across syntax knowledge, type system understanding, functional patterns, and library familiarity. Achievement systems reward consistent practice, concept mastery, and community contributions.

Privacy considerations ensure all analytics respect user consent preferences. Data retention policies define maximum storage periods for personally identifiable information. Export capabilities allow users to download their complete learning history in standard formats.

## Epic 7: Advanced Learning Features

### Requirements and Specifications

Property-based testing exercises integrate QuickCheck directly into the browser environment. Students write properties for blockchain-themed problems like transaction validation, consensus rules, and smart contract invariants. The system provides immediate feedback on property failures with generated counterexamples and shrinking demonstrations.

Multi-file project support enables realistic exercise scenarios spanning multiple modules. Students work with actual Servant applications, implementing new endpoints and middleware. The system manages project-wide compilation while maintaining security boundaries between user workspaces.

The platform supports importing curated external packages compiled to WebAssembly. Initial package selection focuses on commonly used libraries in production Haskell including lens, mtl, aeson, and QuickCheck. Package availability expands as students progress through advanced curriculum sections.

## Epic 8: Community and Collaboration

### Requirements and Specifications

The mentorship system matches experienced students with beginners based on completed curriculum sections and availability preferences. Mentors review submitted solutions, providing feedback through inline code comments and overall solution assessments. The platform tracks mentor contributions, recognizing exceptional mentorship through achievement badges and leaderboard rankings.

Collaborative exercises support pair programming through WebRTC connections with shared editor sessions. Students see real-time cursor positions, selections, and edits from their partners. Voice and text chat integrate directly into the exercise interface, maintaining focus on the learning task.

The solution gallery showcases exemplary submissions for each exercise after student completion. Multiple solution approaches demonstrate Haskell's expressiveness and different programming styles. Community voting highlights particularly elegant or instructive solutions, creating a curated knowledge base of Haskell patterns and techniques.

This implementation plan provides the foundational structure needed to build a comprehensive Haskell learning platform that bridges the gap between Rust knowledge and production Haskell development capabilities. Each epic contains sufficient detail for decomposition into specific development tasks while maintaining flexibility for iterative refinement based on user feedback and technical discoveries during implementation.
